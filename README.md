This repository contains all the necessary information for reproducing the results of "Faster rates of evolution in taller eucalypts with larger genomes". 

This paper looked at four correlates of molecular rate variation in eucalypts: specific leaf area, height, seed mass and genome size.

The raw data files are in the "data" folder. This includes:

1. sequence alignments
2. trait data (with accepted species names checked agains the Australian Plant Census). Included as separate files are two novel datasets:
\t a. SLA measurements for 511 eucalypt species
\t b. genome size measurements for 788 eucalypt species
3. phylogenetic trees created with IQ-TREE from the sequence alignments

This analysis was performed in both a ML and Bayesian framework and all of these scripts are available.
